Inventor
========

Inventor is a Chrome Extension to help you to fill out forms in Brazilizian systems.
It generates several types of data to be used on every regular form you need to fill, 
such as CPF and CNPJ (Nacional people and company registry numbers), Credit Cards and CEP (Postal Code).

I appreciate any contribution.

Enjoy!
